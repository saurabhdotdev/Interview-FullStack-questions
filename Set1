1)What happens when you type a URL in the browser? (Full flow)
Answer:
Browser checks cache / DNS cache.
If not found → sends DNS query → gets IP of server.
Browser opens a TCP connection (3-way handshake).
Sends HTTP request to backend.
Server processes → hits routes → controllers → services → DB → returns response.
Browser receives HTML/JSON → renders UI.
TCP connection closes (unless keep-alive).

2️) Difference between PUT vs PATCH
PUT → Replaces entire object.
PATCH → Updates only specific fields.

3️) What is CORS and why does it occur?
Answer:
CORS = Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
Browser blocks API calls if frontend (origin A) calls backend (origin B) without permission.
Backend must send headers like:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,POST
Occurs to protect users from malicious cross-site requests.

4️) What is middleware?
Code that runs between request and response, e.g.:
Logging
Auth check
Validation
Rate limiting
Example in Express:

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req.method, req.url);
  next();
});

5️) How do you handle errors in backend?
Use global error handler.
Example:
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  res.status(err.status || 500).json({
    message: err.message || 'Server Error'
  });
});

6️) What is JWT?
JWT = JSON Web Token.
Used for authentication.
Flow:
User logs in → backend signs token with secret.
Token stored in localStorage/cookie.
User sends token in Authorization: Bearer <token>.
Backend verifies signature → allows access.

7️) Difference between Authentication vs Authorization

Authentication → Are you the user? (login)

Authorization → Are you allowed to access? (roles/permissions)
